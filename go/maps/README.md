# Maps

[Effective Go: Maps](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go#maps)

A map is a data structure to associate value of one type (the **key**) with
values of another type (the **element** or **value**)

Maps can dynamically remove or add elements

Duplicate entries are not allowed while data is kept unordered
