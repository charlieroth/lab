# Variables

[Go Tour: Variables](https://go.dev/tour/basics/8)

The `var` statement declares a list of variables; as in function argument
lists, the type is last

A `var` statement can be at package or function level

Go will infer the type of initialized variables

Variables declared without a corresponding initialization are **zero-valued**

The `:=` syntax is shorthand for declaring and initializing a variable. This
syntax is only available inside of functions
